# NI LabVIEW CLI - Predefined Command Line Operations (üõ†Ô∏è Under Construction)

## GitHub Actions Runner

### Windows x64
We recommend configuring the runner in a root folder of the Windows drive (e.g. "C:\actions-runner"). This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.

The following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:
``` powershell
# Create a folder under the drive root
mkdir \actions-runner ; cd \actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip
# Extract the installer
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;
[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD\actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip", "$PWD")
```

## GitHub Actions

## Introduction

You only need a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository to create and run a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.

The following example shows you how {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

## Creating your first workflow

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in  your repository on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} if this directory does not already exist. The directory must have this exact name in order for {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} to discover any {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows that it contains.
1. In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file with the `.yml` or `.yaml` extension. This tutorial will use `github-actions-demo.yml` as the file name. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files)."
1. Copy the following YAML contents into the `github-actions-demo.yml` file:

   ```yaml copy
   name: GitHub Actions Demo
   {%- ifversion actions-run-name %}
   run-name: {% raw %}${{ github.actor }}{% endraw %} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
   {%- endif %}
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     Explore-GitHub-Actions:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a {% raw %}${{ github.event_name }}{% endraw %} event."
         - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a {% raw %}${{ runner.os }}{% endraw %} server hosted by GitHub!"
         - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {% raw %}${{ github.ref }}{% endraw %} and your repository is {% raw %}${{ github.repository }}{% endraw %}."
         - name: Check out repository code
           uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}
         - run: echo "üí° The {% raw %}${{ github.repository }}{% endraw %} repository has been cloned to the runner."
         - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
         - name: List files in the repository
           run: |
             ls {% raw %}${{ github.workspace }}{% endraw %}
         - run: echo "üçè This job's status is {% raw %}${{ job.status }}{% endraw %}."
   ```

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. Then, to create a pull request, click **Propose new file**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Commit new file" area of the page.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-commit-new-file.png)

Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the `push` event and runs your workflow.

## Viewing your workflow results

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
1. In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to display, in this example "GitHub Actions Demo."

   ![Screenshot of the "Actions" page. The name of the example workflow, "GitHub Actions Demo", is highlighted by a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-workflow-sidebar.png)
1. From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see, in this example "USERNAME is testing out GitHub Actions."
1. In the left sidebar of the workflow run page, under **Jobs**, click the **Explore-GitHub-Actions** job.

   ![Screenshot of the "Workflow run" page. In the left sidebar, the "Explore-GitHub-Actions" job is highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-job.png)
1. The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

   ![Screenshot of steps run by the workflow.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-logs.png)

   For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
   ![Screenshot of the "List files in the repository" step expanded to show the log output. The output for the step is highlighted with a dark orange highlight.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-log-detail.png)

The example workflow you just added is triggered each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} can work with the contents of your repository. For an in-depth tutorial, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)."

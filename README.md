<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.</p>

<h2>GitHub Actions Runner</h2>

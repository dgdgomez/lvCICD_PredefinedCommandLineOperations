13. Checking the status of a self-hosted runner

13.1. In your repository, navigate to the main page and click **Settings**.
13.2. In the left sidebar, click **Actions**, then click **Runners**.
13.3. Under "Runners", you can view a list of registered runners, including the runner's name, labels, and status.

The status can be one of the following:

* **Idle**: The runner is connected to GitHub and is ready to execute jobs.
* **Active**: The runner is currently executing a job.
* **Offline**: The runner is not connected to GitHub. This could be because the machine is offline, the self-hosted runner application is not running on the machine, or the self-hosted runner application cannot communicate with GitHub.

Go to Settings > Actions > Runners and see de cofigured Runner
